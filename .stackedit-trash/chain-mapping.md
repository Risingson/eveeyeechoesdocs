# Chain Mapping

## Mechanics

 - While syncing your ingame location jumps via wormholes or jump
   bridges will get mapped automatically.
 - Wormhole connections get removed after 48h. You can always remove them manually by clicking the connection line and selecting `Remove Connection` from the solarsystem menu.
 - A connection will get created when jumping a cyno. Stop sync before
   jumping or remove the connection created manually.
 - When pasting wormhole signatures connections to "Unknown Systems" will get created

<!--
#### Viewable Information 
 - For wormhole systems there is no api data available for recent jumps
   or NPC kills.
 - Phenomenons are stated as an extra sub-label. To view its effects
   click the wormhole and select `Show Info` from the menu and switch to the `WH` tab.

## Add data to connections
To add data to connections you can click wormhole connection lines or click wormholes in the solarsystem info pane within the "SIG" tab.
You can edit:<br>

 - Signature codes on both sides<br>
 - K162 side<br>
 - Wormhole code<br>

In solarsystem info pane's `SIG` tab you can merge "Unknown System" connections via dragging and dropping onto wormhole connections created by jumping them.

## Name wormholes
Clicking wormhole systems will show a `Set Wormhole Name` option in solarsystem menu.

## Routing
Wormhole connections can be used for plotting [routes](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sync/waypoints/).
