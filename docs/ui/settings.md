# Settings

## General
#### Doubleclick/tap Mode
With this mode enabled clicking ot tapping a solarsystem will not show the menu. To show the menu you would have to doubleclick/tap it. On connection lines a single click/tap is sufficient to show its menu still.

## User Interface
#### User Interface scale
Use + and - to scale the entire UI. In browsers you can use its native zoom aswell.
#### Color Hue and Saturation
Use + and - to set UI colors.

## Map
#### Extended Map Layout
This will extend maps with routes via different regions connecting back to the current map. This gets rendered via an arc with describing text on it.
Additionally this will display how many systems are connected to a system of another region.
#### Light Map Theme
Toggle dark/light theme.
#### Mono Background
Will disable displaying background graphics and replace with a near-black blue background.
#### Center on Current System
This will tween the system your character is currently in to the center of the screen.
#### Show Current Constellation Outline
Draws an orange outline around all systems of the constellation you are in currently.

## Route
#### Display Route
Will display your route on the map after you used "Set Destination/Waypoint" from solarsystem menu.
#### Shortest/Secure/Insecure Route
Set your preferred travel security. This should match your ingame setting.
#### Avoid Systems
Avoid systems you set avoided by clicking it and choosing "Avoid System" in the solarsystem menu shown (that option is only there while [Client Sync](https://eveeyeechoes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sync/client-synchronisation/) is activated). This should match your ingame setting since setting a system avoided in Eveeye does not set it avoided ingame and vice versa. 
#### Avoidance List
Systems you set avoided are listed here. Clicking the system will let you remove it from the list.

!!! attention
    You should match ingame and eveeye settings to get the same routes ingame and within eveeye. Still routes displayed may not match 100% every time.

## Names
You can set names for your [Custom Marks](https://eveeyeechoes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sharing/custom-marks/) which will display in the map's legend if applicable.
