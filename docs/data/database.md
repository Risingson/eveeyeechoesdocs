# Database Sets
Create your own data sets Custom display on maps.

!!! Wata sharning "Alpha Version"
    Feature still under development.
   
## Creating a set
Enter a name for the set in the input field and hit enter. 
Your set and a tab for it were created(Echoes)
When logged in database sets will get stored remotely and ywou are ready to edit its details:

|  |  |
|--|--|
| Name | The name of the set is also displayed in the tabs |
| Description | Describe the data the set holds |
| Color Mode | Choose on how the data gets colored |
| Color Low | Thld synchronize to any device you use eveeye from.

## Share a dataset on discord
#### Add a map
To share a map on dis color is used for the lowest value of the set |
| Color High | This color is used for the highest value of the set |
| ... | ... under development |

!!! Information "Low and high values"
    Lowest and highest values are chosen globally at the moment = If the highest or lowest values for that set are on another map those values will still be used for coloring. If you would like a mode where low and high are calculated from the displayed systems only let me know (use the [feedback forum](https://feedback.userreport.com/7ab42bbb-8bf8-4955-9573-c0b1213b1ba7/#ideas/popular) please). 

### Individual color mode
Will color each distinct value or label with an own color. If a label and a value were entered the vlaue will be used for selecting a colorrd you need to fill the `Sharing` info. Enter a discord server name there and hit enter. If you are a part of that server it will get linked to it.
Anyone else that is automahentically.

### Linear and Logarithmic color modes
Only numeric values can be colored using these modes. The lowest and highest value's colors can be set via the set's details. Other value's colors get interpolated. To understand how those modes' results look like it is best to enter some values and switch the modes. Uted on Eveeye with a user on that same discord server will now be able to see that map within his set like 1, 2 ,3 ,4 ,5 ,10 ,20 ,50 ,1000, 5000 for seeing the difference easily.

## Adding Data
To add data you need to load a regional map. Opening a database set's details will show all systems on that map in a table. Edit the data and watch the map display it right away. With the details open clicking a system will sort that system to top of the list and put the cursor in the value's input field to edit right away. To bring up the normal solarsystem menu you can double-click it.

## Data Display
When opening a set's details the display options `Node` and `Label` will get activated automatically. You can  display your data via `Sectors` or `Tags` aswell. Please select them via the data displays menu. 

## Sharing maps

!!! Information 
    For Eveeye Echoes [check this page please](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data/ee-database-sharing/)
    
Choose to share your map-data with your share-group or publically.

## External Data
You can feed external data to eveeye by pasting an url to a JSON array, CSV or plain text file.
If you are using this feature you won't be able to edit data within eveeye.

!!! Warning "In Development"
    This feature is under development. Things are likely to change.
    
### Header 
The data file should provide the `Last-Modified` header.

!!! Information "In Development"
    THIS IS NOT SETTLED but if there is no header there will be no automatic updating (which is not implemented yet) if that set is shared. Maybe there will be a possibility to add a date to the file itself but i am undecided on that.

### Data
The data file has to contain the following keys:

| key | description | type | max |
|--|--|--|--|
| ss | solarsystem name or id | string or numeric | - |
| lbl | label | string or numeric | 30 chars |
| val | value | string or numeric | 6 chars |

Either a label or value should be present with a solarsystem.

#### JSON Example

    [{"ss":30004738,"val":1},{"ss":"Shenda","lbl":"Hello, "},{"ss":30004271,"lbl":"3","val":"World"}]

#### CSV / TXT Example
30004738,,1<br>
Shenda,"Hello, "<br>
30004271,3,World<br>


### Googlst and may add that map to display.
#### Remove a map from sharing
To not share a map anymore hit `UNLINK` within the `Sharing` info line of a set's details. This will not remove the latest version from anyone who added that map but it would not get updated for them anymore. If removed by the ones using that legacy map it cannot be added back.
#### Map ownership
Currently a map is owned by the user that created it originally. Also only that user can edit the map. 

!!! help
