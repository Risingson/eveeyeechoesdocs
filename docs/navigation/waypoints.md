# Waypoints


## Interaction
To set a route you need to set a current system first. Do so by clicking a solarsystem and choose `Set Current System` from the menu.

In the menu you can also select to `Avoid System`. To manage your avoided systems goto the `ROUTE` tab in <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Risingson/eedocs/master/docs/images/Settings-100_off.png" width="24" height="24" > [Settings](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ui/settings/#Route).

On top of a route the following icons will be displayed:

|  |  |
|--|--|
| ![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Risingson/eedocs/master/docs/images/copy.png) | Copy a waypoint list to the clipboard. This can be shared and pasted to eveeye. |
| ![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Risingson/eedocs/master/docs/images/save.png) | Click to name and store this route. |

!!! attention "Ingame vs Eveeye Echoes route"
    You should match ingame and eveeye settings to get the same routes ingame and within eveeye. Still routes displayed may not match 100% every time.
