# Waypoints
With sync active you got the possibility to set destinations/waypoints from Eveeye to the EVE client. 

## Interaction
To set a route you need to set a current system first. Do so by clicking a solarsystem and choose `Set Current System` from the menu.



In the menu you can also select to `Avoid System`. To manage your avoided systems goto the `ROUTE` tab in <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Risingson/eedocs/master/docs/images/Settings-100_off.png" width="24" height="24" > [Settings](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ui/settings/#Route).

!!! attention "Ingame vs Eveeye Echoes route"
    You should match ingame and eveeye settings to get the same routes ingame and within eveeye. Still routes displayed may not match 100% every time. Eveeye will detect and re-calc the route displayed in eveeye if you took a different path though.

#### Route Manipulation
Clicking the colored square or else in the route legend will trigger a menu with some options where applicable:

 
|  |  |
|--|--|
| Clear Route | Will clear your route ingame and in eveeye |
| Turn into Waypoint | Will stop your ship in this system if autopiloting |
| Remove Waypoint | Will not stop your ship in this system if autopiloting |
| Add again at end of route | Will add that system as a waypoint to the end of your route |
| Set sole destination | Will clear current route and set that system as destination |

## Wormholes/Jumpbridges
When you got one or both of the options `Use Wormholes` or `Use Jumpbridges` enabled in [Routing Settings](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ui/settings/#Route) calculating the route will consider those connections. If a route is found that includes [wormhole](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/map/chain-mapping/) or [jumpbridge](https://eveeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sharing/jumpbridges/) waypoints will be set accordingly.

#### Example
We like to go from `PR-8CA` to `Nasreri`.<br>
The shortest route from `PR-8CA` to `Nasreri` via k-space is 32 jumps.<br> ![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Risingson/eedocs/master/docs/images/route/Wormhole_routing_00.png)

A 12-jump route using a detour via Thera was found:<br>![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Risingson/eedocs/master/docs/images/route/Wormhole_routing_0.png)

If you `Set Destination` to `Nasreri` via Eveeye the app will set a waypoint at `PUIG-F`. There you would have to find the entrance to Thera. The corresponding Signature Code is found in the solarsystem-tab `SIG` or on the line on the map. From Thera do the same for the exit -in this case- to `Vecamia`. After jumping back to k-space the client will show the last 4 jumps.<br>

Within the EVE Client your route would look like this since the client does not plot routes via wormholes:<br>![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Risingson/eedocs/master/docs/images/route/Wormhole_routing_03.png)
