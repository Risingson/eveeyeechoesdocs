# Character Management
Logging in characters via Discord is not necessary to use this app but unlocks the following features:

 - Synchronize your Custom Map Data across devices
 - Share Custom Map Data with people on a Discord Server

## Discord Login 
This app uses Discord oauth login to authenticate characters. 

!!! success "Security"
    A complementary key is stored on the eveeye server. It alone cannot be used to authenticate a user.

To revoke access for Eveeye goto [https://community.eveonline.com/support/third-party-applications/](https://community.eveonline.com/support/third-party-applications/)](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219576828-Setting-up-Two-Factor-Authentication). It can be enabled in your Discord account settings under `My Account`.

To revoke access for Eveeye goto the `Authorized Apps` within Discord settings and hit `Deauthorize`.

## Login process
To add characters tap <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Risingson/eedocs/master/docs/images/User-100_26_100_off.png" width="24" height="24" > or your character's portrait in the menu. After selecting to add a character you will get redirected to a new native browser window to log into Discord and then back to Eveeye with the user added. 

To remove a character tap <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Risingson/eedocs/master/docs/images/Minus-100_b.png" width="24" height="24" > in the menu. This will remove any tokens available to login the character but will keep other data like for example custom names stored to not loose that data by accident. To fully remove custom data un-install and re-install the app or clear browser cache.

<!-- When using the cloud storage feature your user including the token stored to identify your char gets removed from cloud immediately. Your custom data will get deleted from cloud 30 days after char removal. -->

## Re-authing
If you updated your charactuser image you can update it by just authorizing the user again. Also if a new version of Eveeye was installed sometimes it would need you to authorize your characters again to use new features.

## Revoking access
To remove permissions voke access for Eveeye goto the `Authorized Apps` within Discord settings and hit `Deauthorize`.
